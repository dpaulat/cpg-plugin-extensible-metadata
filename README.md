# cpg-plugin-extensible-metadata

The Extensible Metadata plugin is designed for Coppermine Gallery 1.6.x.  Coppermine Gallery has built-in support for EXIF and IPTC metadata, but lacks support for XMP.  This plugin allows for the generation of XMP sidecar files containing additional metadata.  The metadata fields can then be selectively used for display with the images, or added to a search index.

The plugin has the following dependencies:
- jQuery Update (http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php?topic=77595.0)
- jQuery UI (https://github.com/dpaulat/cpg-plugin-jquery-ui)

Recommended (tested) configuration:
- jQuery 3.2.1
- jQuery UI 1.12.1

Minimum (untested) configuration:
- jQuery 1.2.6
- jQuery UI 1.6
